%% Functional Magentic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) & Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)
%
% Functional Magentic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique that
% uses a powerful electro-magnet that is able to detect changes within the 
% magnetic field it generates. Using fMRI, we are able to collect an
% indirect measure of neuronal activitiy due to the fluctations in blood
% flow when a region of the brain has been activated. 
%
% Neurons require oxygen to fuel their activity and oxygen is carried to 
% the neurons via the hemoglobin in red blood cells. When there is an 
% increase in neuronal activity, there is an increase of blood flow to that
% region of cortex. After the hemoglobin has become deoxygenated, the 
% hemoglobin is briefly paramagnetic. This change in magnetic property 
% can be detected by the electro-magnet. This is why fMRI is also known as
% Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Imaging. 
% 
% The BOLD response can be approximated by the Hemodynamic Response
% Function (HRF). For this tutorial's purposes a gamma function, which is
% the result of an n stage leaky integrator, will be used to represent the 
% BOLD response as a function of time (t):
% 
% $$hrf(t;n,\tau,\delta) = \frac{\left(\frac{t-\delta}{\tau}\right)^{(n-1)}e^{-\left(\frac{t-\delta}{\tau}\right)}}{\tau(n-1)!}$$
%
% Or in MATLAB:
% 
% hrf(t;n,tau,delta) = ((t-delta)/tau).^(n-1).*exp(-(t-delta)/tau)/(tau*factorial(n-1))
% 
% where n is the phase delay, ${\tau}$ is the time constant, and ${\delta}$
% is the delay in seconds.
%
% The HRF varies in the cortex from region-to-region and from 
% person-to-person, but there are canonical HRF parameters for highly 
% studied regions, such as primary visual cortex (V1). 

opt.n = 3;                  % phase delay
opt.tau = 1.5;              % time constant
opt.delta = 2.5;            % delay, seconds
t = linspace(0,30,1000);    % time
hrf = gammaHRF(opt.n, opt.tau, opt.delta, t);

%% Interlude: Spatial and Temporal Resolution in fMRI
%
% fMRI is known as a technique with decent spatial resolution but poor
% temporal resolution. This is addressed currently to introduce a few
% terminologies that will continue forth throughout the tutorial.
%
% Spatial resolution in fMRI is spoken about in terms voxel (volume 
% element) size. If we think of the brain as a pixelated three-dimensional
% mass, a pixel in that 3D mass is a voxel. A voxel contains a collection 
% of hundred thousands of neurons, though this varies. Voxel resolutions 
% typically range from $1x1x1$ $mm^{3}$ to $3x3x3$ $mm^{3}$. MRI, or 
% Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is used to image the anatomy (structure) of 
% the brain and is usually collected at a $1x1x1$ $mm^{3}$ resolution. 
% Structural scans are unconcerned with the activity (function) that
% occurs, and is used throughout the medical profession. Whereas fMRI 
% (functional scans), are typically collected at $3x3x3$ $mm^{3}$ to 
% compensate for the fact that functional activity has to be collected 
% through time and this taxes the electro-magnet's ability to accurately
% collect data at finer resolutions.
% 
% Temporal resolution in fMRI is poor. Not only is the measure obtained by
% fMRI an indirect measure, the BOLD response is also notoriously slow. The
% BOLD response peaks around 4 to 5 seconds (depending) after stimulus
% presentation. On top of that, the time course can only be sampled every
% few seconds due to the electro-magnet's limitations. Time to repetition,
% or TR, is the sampling rate at which the BOLD response time course can be
% collected. A common TR is 2 seconds, which is what this tutorial uses.
% At each TR, the fMRI acquires a volume, which is a snap shot of the
% brain at that TR. Occasionally, this tutorial will refer to the time 
% domain in units of TRs or volumes.

%% The Brain as a Linear System: Single Stimulus Presentation

impulse = zeros(length(t),1);
impulse(100,1) = 1; % 3 seconds

response = conv(impulse, hrf(:));
response = response(1:length(t));

figure2(t, impulse, hrf, response);

%% 
% *Figure 2.* 
% 
% Let's pretend we presented a single stimulus at 3 seconds and the 
% population of neurons in a voxel responds maximally to this particular 
% stimulus. The BOLD response we would collect would be the convolution of 
% the neuronal response and the HRF.

%% The Brain as a Linear System: Multiple Stimulus Presentations

impulse = zeros(length(t),3);
impulse(100,1) = 1; % 3 seconds
impulse(200,2) = 1; % 6 seconds
impulse(300,3) = 1; % 9 seconds

neural = impulse;
neural(300,3) = 0.5;

response = cellfun(@(x) conv(x,hrf), num2cell(neural,1), 'UniformOutput', false);
response = cell2mat(cellfun(@(x) x(1:length(t))', response, 'UniformOutput', false));

figure3(t, impulse, neural, hrf, response);

%%
% *Figure 3.*
% 
% Now let's pretend we presented the same stimulus as before but this time
% at 3, 6, and 9 seconds. The neuronal population responds maximally to 
% this particular stimulus at the first two presentation, but at half 
% strength by the third presentation (possibly an adaptation effect). In 
% the bottom panel of Figure 3. Each dashed red line represents the 
% convolution of the HRF and the voxel response to an individual stimulus 
% (dashed red), but the measured BOLD response would the linear summation 
% of all the indivudual responses (blue).

%% Differential Neuronal Response to Stimuli: Example 1

opt.TR = 2; % TR, seconds 
opt.stimuli = 1:6; % different stimulus types
paradigm = [opt.stimuli(1:(length(opt.stimuli)/2)) NaN(1,6) ...
    opt.stimuli(((length(opt.stimuli)/2)+1):end) NaN(1,6)]; % paradigm sequence
opt.nVols = length(paradigm); % number of volumes
opt.cMap = hsv(length(opt.stimuli)) * 0.85; % color map

t = 0:opt.TR:30; % time in opt.TR steps
hrf = gammaHRF(opt.n, opt.tau, opt.delta, t); 
stimulusMatrix = zeros(length(opt.stimuli), opt.nVols);
for i = 1:length(paradigm)
    if ~isnan(paradigm(i))
        stimulusMatrix(:,i) = opt.stimuli == paradigm(i);
    end
end

neural = [1 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5]; % neural response to each stimuli

[stimulusImpulse] = figure4(stimulusMatrix, neural, opt);

%% 
% *Figure 4.*
% 
% _Top._ If we are presenting multiple types of stimuli, then we can 
% represent which stimulus (1-6) was presented and when with a stimulus 
% matrix. Each stimulus is identified by the row it inhabits and when a 
% stimulus was presented can be viewed along the columns of the matrix.
% This creates a [number of stimuli, number of volumes] matrix.
% 
% _Bottom._ The neural response can still be visualized as before. In this
% example, stimulus 1, 2, and 3 evoke a strong response from this
% population of neurons, but only a half maximum response from stimuli 4, 
% 5, and 6. 

%% Convolved Differential Neuronal Response to Stimuli: Example 1

convolvedMatrix = opt.TR * convn(diag(neural)*stimulusMatrix, hrf);
convolvedMatrix = convolvedMatrix(:,1:opt.nVols); 

figure5(convolvedMatrix, stimulusImpulse, opt)

%%
% *Figure 5.*
% 
% _Top._ The Convolved Matrix is the convolution of the stimulus matrix and 
% the HRF in time also weighted by the neuronal response to each stimulus.
% Note that for stimulus 1, 2, and 3, the response is stronger (whiter) 
% than the response to stimulsu 4, 5, and 6. The Convolved Matrix has been 
% truncated to remain within the number of volumes that was acquired during
% the fMRI session.
%
% _Bottom._ The final BOLD response (gray line) is the linear summation of 
% the individual responses to each stimulus (colored lines). Note that 
% similarly to the convolved matrix, the responses to stimulus 4, 5, and 6 
% are half of the response to stimulus 1, 2, and 3. 

%% Differential Neuronal Response to Stimuli: Example 2
%
% Let's take a look at what would happen if the neuronal response changes
% but the stimulus matrix is kept the same.

opt.mu = 3;
opt.sigma = 1;
tuning = gaussian(opt.mu, opt.sigma, opt.stimuli);

[stimulusImpulse] = figure6(stimulusMatrix, tuning, opt);

%% 
% *Figure 6.*
% 
% _Top._ The same stimulus matrix as in Figure 4.
% 
% _Bottom._ The intersting thing to note is that there is a differential 
% neuronal response to the each stimulus that is different from the 
% previous example. Stimulus 3 evokes the strongest response from this 
% neuron, then stimulus 2 and 4, and stimulus 1, 5, and 6 barely activate 
% the voxel. 

%% Convolved Differential Neuronal Response to Stimuli: Example 2

convolvedMatrix = opt.TR * convn(diag(tuning)*stimulusMatrix, hrf);
convolvedMatrix = convolvedMatrix(:,1:opt.nVols);

figure7(convolvedMatrix, stimulusImpulse, opt);

%%
% *Figure 7.*
% 
% _Top._ The convolved matrix for this same stimulus matrix but with 
% different neuronal weighting of each stimulus. Note that for stimulus 3
% has the greatest response (whiter) than all other stimuli.
%
% _Bottom._ The final BOLD response (gray line) is the linear summation of 
% the individual responses to each stimulus (dashed colored lines). The 
% voxel responsed the strongest to stimulus 3 (green), or in other words,
% it can be said that this voxel 'prefers' stimulus 3. 
%
% Breaking down the BOLD response, stimulus 3 contributes the most to the 
% first BOLD response bump and stimulus 4 (light blue) contributes the most
% to the second BOLD response bump.

%% Neuronal Tuning Functions: Characterizing Differential Neuronal Responses 

figure8(stimulusMatrix, neural, tuning, opt);

%%
% *Figure 8.*
%
% _Left._ The same neuronal responses from Figures 4 and 6 respectively.
%
% _Right._ If we plot the neuronal response as a function of the stimulus 
% space instead of as a function of time (left), we arrive at the stem 
% plots on the right, where each color represents a particular stimulus. We
% can characterize the differential neuronal response to the given stimulus 
% space with functions (dashed gray). The top right resembles a step 
% function and the bottom right resembles a one-dimensional Gaussian (as it
% should, this neuronal tuning function was generated with a ${\mu}$
% (center) of 3 and a ${\sigma}$ (spread) of 1).

%% The Brain as a Linear System: Combining All the Pieces
% 
% Now let's put all the pieces together.

[convolvedMatrix,responseMatrix] = figure9(stimulusMatrix, tuning, opt);

%%
% *Figure 9.*
% 
% # _Stimulus Matrix:_ 
% We have the [number of stimuli, number of volumes] Stimulus Matrix that
% represents which stimulus was presented when.
% # _Convolved Matrix = Stimulus Matrix * HRF:_ 
% We then convolved the Stimulus Matrix with the HRF, creating the
% Convolved Matrix. 
% # _Response = Neural Tuning x (Stimulus Matrix * HRF):_ 
% This Convolved Matrix is then multipled by the neuronal tuning function,
% which weights how much the voxel will respond to a particular stimulus.
% # _BOLD Response:_
% Finally, flattening the matrix into the time domain (collapsing by rows),
% the response (grey) is a linear summation of the individual responses to
% each stimulus (colored lines). 
%
% A note to keep in mind is the resolution of the acquired BOLD response; 
% the BOLD response is limited to the TR length. This is indicated by
% the 'o' symbols.

%% Population Receptive Field (pRF) Modeling
%
% Population receptive field modeling (pRF; Dumoulin & Wandell, 2008) was
% developed to map out receptive fields in primary visual cortex (V1) in 
% humans. It has since be adapted to be used out other primary sensory
% areas such as in human primary auditory cortex (PAC; 
% Thomas et al., 2015), although the name of the method has remained the 
% same even when it has been used to estimate regions that do not have 
% receptive fields.
%
% The pRF model uses the linearity assumption that this tutorial has 
% previous walked through. But in reference to the specific equation this
% tutorial has been using:
% 
% BOLD Response = Neuronal Tuning x (Stimulus Matrix * HRF)
%
% The pRF model would be the neuronal tuning part of the equation. We
% estimate a pRF model independently for each voxel in our region(s) of
% interest. This tutorial will now continue forward, first, by estimating a
% pRF model for a single voxel, and then working our way to estimtaing a
% pRF model for multple voxels.

%% Estimating the pRF Model With and Without Noise in the System
%
% Remember under the assumption that the brain is a linear system, the
% voxel-wise BOLD response can be interpret as:
%
% BOLD Response = (Stimulus Matrix * HRF) x Neuronal Tuning 
%
% where (Stimulus Matrix * HRF) can also be abbreviated as the Convolved
% Matrix.
%
% That means, we should be able to undo these operations with linear
% algebra.

modelEstimate = sum(responseMatrix) * pinv(convolvedMatrix); % without noise

%%
% However, noise in the response or in the measurement acquisition is
% always the case with fMRI data. This noise comes from various sources, 
% such as distortions in the magnetic field generated by the electro-magnet 
% and/or movement (head or respiratory) distortions by the subject. In this 
% tutorial, we will simply add Gaussian noise $({\mu} = 0, {\sigma} = 
% 0.05)$ to the response.

rng(42); % setting seed
responseNoise = sum(responseMatrix) + randn(size(sum(responseMatrix))) * 0.05;
modelEstimateNoise = responseNoise * pinv(convolvedMatrix); % with noise

%%
% Another way to estimate the neuronal tuning function is to use a 
% non-linear optimization method. MATLAB has a built-in function called
% 'fminsearch.m' that implements the Nelder-Mead method to solve non-linear
% optimization problems. The function 'fitcon.m' is a wrapper function to
% call the fitting functions, in which a function to be minimized can be
% passed (i.e., 'fitpRFModel') by adjusting the constrained parameters,
% ${1<\mu<6}$ and ${0.01<\sigma<1.5}$. We will compare the two methods to 
% see how well each estimates the neuronal tuning function when there is 
% noise in the response.

params.mu = 4; % mu seed
params.sigma = 1; % sigma seed
[fitParams,fitErr] = fitcon('fitpRFModel', params, ...
    {'1<mu<6', '0.01<sigma<1.5'}, convolvedMatrix, responseNoise, opt.stimuli);

[modelEstimateFit] = figure10(modelEstimate, modelEstimateNoise, fitParams, opt);

%%
% *Figure 10.*
% 
% _Top._ Estimating the neurinal tuning function by using linear algebra 
% and no noise in the response:
% 
% Neuronal Tuning = BOLD Response * pseudoinverse(Convolved Matrix)
% 
% If the BOLD Response was not subject to noise, then we would be able to
% recover the true neuronal tuning function.
%
% _Middle._ Estimating the neuronal tuning function by using linear algebra
% with noise in the response. There operation performed is the same as in 
% the top panel:
%
% But with the addition of a Gaussian noise $({\mu} = 0, {\sigma} = 
% 0.05)$, this can already drastically decrease the performance of the
% estimatation.
%
% _Bottom._ Estimating the neuronal tuning function by using a non-linear 
% optimization method with noise in the response. 
%
% The non-linear optimaization method is more robust to noise in the
% system as compared to the linear algebra solution. This is usually the 
% method of choice for fitting pRF models in the current literature.

%% Inverting the Question: Decoding the Stimulus
%
% Alright, let's go back to the initial equation that helped create the pRF
% model:
% 
% BOLD Response = Neuronal Tuning x (Stimulus Matrix * HRF)
%
% We have estimated the Neuronal Tuning function (pRF model) using a
% non-linear optimization method. This pRF model should remain the same
% regardless of the stimulus paradigm that is presented. 
%
% Given that we have a pRF model, the HRF, and the BOLD Response - can we
% decode the Stimulus Matrix?
% 
% This will require a little bit of linear algebra to construct 'Decoding
% Matrix' that will perform the operation we desire. We want a decoding
% matrix that will, when multiplied with a vectorized Stimulus Matrix, give
% a predicted BOLD response. The equation looks something like this:
%
% Predicted BOLD Response = (Decoding Matrix * HRF) x Stimulus Matrix(:)
%
% The Predicted BOLD Response should be a column vector with dimensions of
% [numbers of volumes, 1].
%
% The Stimulus Matrix, when unwrapped to be a column vector, will have a
% dimensions of [number of stimulus x number of volumes, 1].
%
% Therefore, the Decoding Matrix must have the dimensions of
% [number of volumes, number of stimulus x number of volumes].
%
% This creates a Decoding Matrix that will contain the pRF model estimate
% that is already [1, number of stimulus], repeated [number of volumes]
% times, through time. Lastly, we will convolved the decoding matrix, while
% retain the previous descrbed dimensions. If this is confusing, that is 
% because it is. Hopefully, a figure will help clear things up.

%% Decoding Matrix: A Single Voxel

% times.

    tmp = convn(tmp, hrf(:));
    decodeMatrix(:,((opt.nStim*i)-(opt.nStim-1)):(opt.nStim*i)) = tmp(1:opt.nVols,:);
end

% If the tutorial is running in MATLAB, you can click on the larger

%% Create a New Stimulus Matrix to Decode
%
% Because it would be circular to try and decode the Stimulus Matrix 
% that created the pRF model was created from, we must validate the model 
% by trying to decode a Stimulus Matrix the model has never seen before.
%
% We will generate a new stimulus matrix by shuffling the placements of
% which stimulus was presented when from the old stimulus matrix. Each
% stimulus still only show up once and the rest placements are still
% identical to the previous stimulus matrix.

rng(100); % set seed
testStimuli = opt.stimuli(randperm(length(opt.stimuli))); % generate new test stimulus matrix
paradigm(~isnan(paradigm)) = testStimuli;

stimulusMatrix = zeros(length(opt.stimuli), opt.nVols);
for i = 1:length(paradigm)
    if ~isnan(paradigm(i))
        stimulusMatrix(paradigm(i),i) = 1;
    end
end

%% 
% The actual response to this new stimulus matrix would be the as we have
% seen before:
% BOLD Response = Neuronal Tuning * (Stimulus Matrix * HRF)

convolvedMatrix = convn(stimulusMatrix, hrf);
convolvedMatrix = convolvedMatrix(:,1:opt.nVols);
actualResponse = tuning * convolvedMatrix; % actual response

%% 
% And the noisy response will once again be the true response with some
% Gaussian noise.

responseNoise = actualResponse + randn(size(sum(actualResponse))) * 0.05;

%% Decoding the Test Stimulus Matrix: A Single Voxel
% 
% To decode the new stimulus matrix, we are going to iteratively go through
% each volume and create stimulus matrix ('stim') where only one stimulus 
% has been placed in. Multiply that stimulus matrix to obtained a predicted
% response that we will then use to correlate with the response with noise.
% This procedure is performed for every stimulus. After each stimlus has
% been tested, we select the stimulus that gave the best correlation to be 
% the decoded stimulus (for that volume). This is repeated until a decoded 
% stimlus is obtained for every volume.
 
decodedParadigm = NaN(1, opt.nVols);
for i = 1:opt.nVols % for every volume
    err = zeros(opt.nStim,1);
    for i2 = 1:opt.nStim % for every stimulus
        stim = zeros(opt.nStim, opt.nVols); 
        stim(i2,i) = 1; 
        predResp = decodeMatrix * stim(:); % decode!
        tmp = corrcoef(predResp, responseNoise(:)); % correlate prediced with actual
        err(i2) = tmp(1,2); % save correlation
    end
    [~,id] = max(err); % find best correlation
    decodedParadigm(i) = id;
end

%% Calculate the Best Lag
%
% Due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, we have the calculate the 
% best lag for the decoded paradigm by correlating it with the actual
% paradigm.
%
% To do so, we take the first half of the actual paradigm sequence (without
% the rests) and we correlate it at every lag step possible in the decoded
% paradigm.

actualParadigm1 = paradigm(1:(length(paradigm)/2));
actualParadigm1 = actualParadigm1(~isnan(actualParadigm1));
decodedParadigm1 = decodedParadigm(1:(length(decodedParadigm)/2));

lagCorr = NaN(1, (length(decodedParadigm1)-length(actualParadigm1)+1));
for i = 1:(length(decodedParadigm1)-length(actualParadigm1)+1)
    tmp = decodedParadigm1(i:(i+length(actualParadigm1)-1));
    tmp = corrcoef(actualParadigm1(:), tmp(:));
    lagCorr(i) = tmp(1,2);
end
[~,lag] = max(lagCorr);

%%
% The best lag is then used on the decoded paradigm to find the best
% starting point for all of the decoded stimlus. The rests are reintroduced
% into the decoded stimulus sequence where the rests were in the actual
% paradigm sequence.

decodedParadigm = decodedParadigm(lag:end); % move the decoded paradigm
decodedParadigm(isnan(paradigm)) = NaN; % reintroduce rests

%% Decoded Stimulus

decodedStimulus = zeros(opt.nStim, opt.nVols);
for i = 1:opt.nVols
    if ~isnan(decodedStimulus(i))
        decodedStimulus(:,i) = opt.stimuli == decodedParadigm(i);

end

%
% _Top._ Actual stimulus matrix.
%
% _Bottom._ Decoded stimulus matrix.
%
% We can tell visually that this has been a poor attempt at decoding the
% stimulus matrix. The first 2 decoded stimuli has lumped together stimulus
% 5 and 6 into a stimulus 4. And the third decoded stimulus missing the 
% mark a little by predicting stimulus 2 as a 1. The decoding did manage to
% get stimulus 3 and 4 correct, but completely messed up stimulus 1. 
% Overall, the decoding was alright, but keep in mind that the noise in the 
% 'measured' response was kept low with a ${\sigma}$ of 0.05. If there were
% more noise in the system (as there often is), this decoding probably have
% failed.

%% Estimating a Voxel-Wise pRF Model for Multiple Voxels
%
% It is unrealistic to expect that decoding with a single voxel would
% produce great results. That's why we're now including 100 voxels in an 
% attempt to decode the stimulus sequence. This many voxels is more
% reasonable size as compared to commonly studied regions of interest in
% the brain.

rng(100); % set seed
opt.nVox = 100; % number of voxels

%%
% First, we will generate the true ${\mu}$'s and ${\sigma}$'s for each
% voxel. The ${\mu}$'s will be randomly defined with the stimulus space 
% (from 1 to 6) and the ${\sigma}$'s will be randomly sampled within the
% range of 0.5 to 3. This will be used to generate the actual voxel BOLD
% responses.

mu = min(opt.stimuli)+(max(opt.stimuli)-min(opt.stimuli)).*rand(opt.nVox,1);
sigma = (min(opt.stimuli)/2)+(max(opt.stimuli)/2-min(opt.stimuli)/2).*rand(opt.nVox,1);

modelMatrix = cell2mat(arrayfun(@(x,y) gaussian(x,y,opt.stimuli), mu, ...
    sigma, 'UniformOutput', false));

convolvedMatrix = convn(stimulusMatrix, hrf);

responseMatrix = modelMatrix * convolvedMatrix; % actual response

%%
% After simulating the true voxel time courses, random Gaussian noise 
% $({\mu} = 0, {\sigma} = 0.05)$ is added to the response.

responseNoiseMatrix = responseMatrix + (0.05 * randn(size(responseMatrix))); % actual + noise

%% 
% The response with noise is the data from which we will estimate a  
% Gaussian pRF model parameters, ${\mu}$ and ${\sigma}$. We will once again 
% be using the non-linear optimization method by calling 'fitcon.m' to 
% minimize the function 'fitpRFVoxelModel.m'. This takes a little time to 
% run on my computer, so please be patient.

%% Decoding the Test Stimulus Matrix: Multiple Voxel
% 
% To decode the new stimulus matrix, even with multiple voxels, is same
% process. We will iteratively step through each volume and each stimulus
% to find the stimulus that will give the best correlation to the response
% with noise. The only step that is different than trying to decode with a
% single voxel, is that we will reshape the predicted response back into a
% [number of voxels, number of volumes] matrix, before unwrapping it into
% a column vector for correlation.

decodeMatrix = cell2mat(decodeMatrix);
decodedParadigm = NaN(1, opt.nVols);
for i = 1:opt.nVols
    err = zeros(opt.nStim,1);
    for i2 = 1:opt.nStim
        stim = zeros(opt.nStim, opt.nVols);
        stim(i2,i) = 1;
        predResp = decodeMatrix * stim(:);
        predResp = reshape(predResp, opt.nVols, opt.nVox)'; % reshape!
        tmp = corrcoef(predResp(:), responseNoiseMatrix(:));
        err(i2) = tmp(1,2);

%
% We can tell visually that this has been a better attempt at decoding the
% stimulus matrix. The first 2 decoded stimuli have been separated (as
% compared with the single voxel decoding). But the third decoded stimulus 
% still misss the mark a little by predicting stimulus 2 as a 1. The 
% decoding did manage to get stimulus 3 and 4 correct again, and has 
% managed to only barely missed decoding stimulus 1 as 3. Overall, the
% decoding was better, but again keep in mind that the noise in the 
% 'measured' response was kept low with a ${\sigma}$ of 0.05. If there were
% more noise in the system (as there often is), this decoding probably have
% been worse.

%% Conclusion
%
% After walking through this tutorial, we have a better understanding of
% how the pRF model is estimated and how we can take the estimated pRF
% model to try and decode the stimlus matrix.
%
% A few caveats about this method and the assumptions it uses. This method
% is extremely sensitive to noise in the measured response. Too much noise
% and an accurate pRF model will not be able to be fitted even though we 
% are using a non-linear optimization method. Too much noise and decoding 
% the stimulus will also be practically impossible. This method has been 
% tested well in primary sensory areas (i.e., primary visual cortex and 
% primary auditory cortex); however, as we move towards higher order areas, 
% the assumption of linearity might not hold. These are all points to think
% about as this method develops.
%
% However, there are benefits to using this method. A pRF model is able to
% characterize a voxel's 'preferred' stimulus through parameterization in
% an arbitray stimlus space defined by the researcher. This leads to 
% future research questions that could find the paramaterized features a 
% specific region in the brain would respond to. This method also makes it
% possible to compare differences in characterization between groups and 
% regions (within a subject). And one the decoding side of the method, it
% provided a stimple validation test for the estimated pRF model. But, the
% strongest benefit to this method is that it provides a linking model 
% between neuronal responses to behavioral and perceptual experience.
